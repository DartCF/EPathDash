2023/11/20,GSE239718,"The Staphylococcus aureus CamS lipoprotein is a repressor of toxin production that shapes host-pathogen interaction","Lipoproteins of the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus play a crucial role in various cellular processes and host interactions. Consisting of a protein and a lipid moiety, they support nutrient acquisition and anchor the protein to the bacterial membrane. Recently, we identified several processed and secreted small linear peptides that derive from the secretion signal sequence of S. aureus lipoproteins. Here, we show for the first time, that the protein moiety of the S. aureus lipoprotein CamS has a biological role that is distinct from its associated linear peptide staph-cAM373. The small peptide was shown to be involved in interspecies horizontal gene transfer, the primary mechanism for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance among bacteria. We provide evidence that the CamS protein moiety is a potent repressor of cytotoxins, such as Î±-toxin and leukocidins. The CamS-mediated suppression of toxin transcription was reflected by altered disease severity in in vivo infection models involving skin and soft tissue, as well as bloodstream infections. Collectively, we have uncovered the role of the protein moiety of the staphylococcal lipoprotein CamS as a previously uncharacterized repressor of S. aureus toxin production, which consequently regulates virulence and disease outcomes. Notably, the camS gene is conserved in S. aureus, and we also demonstrated the muted transcriptional response of cytotoxins in another S. aureus lineage. Our findings provide the first evidence of distinct biological functions of the protein moiety and its associated linear peptide for a specific lipoprotein. Therefore, lipoproteins in S. aureus consist of three functional components: a lipid moiety, a protein moiety, and a small linear peptide, with putative different biological roles that might not only determine the outcome of host-pathogen interactions but also drive the acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants.",USA300,NA,NA,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE239718
